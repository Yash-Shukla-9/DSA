      Execution context is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that helps manage
      the execution of code. It provides an environment in which JavaScript code
      is executed and variables, functions, and objects are created and stored.
      An execution context can be thought of as a container that holds all the
      necessary information for the execution of a piece of code. This
      information includes variable and function declarations, the value of the
      "this" keyword, and a reference to the outer environment.

      There are threetypes of execution contexts in JavaScript: Global Execution
      Context: <br />
      <br />
      The global execution context is created when the script is first loaded.
      It represents the default execution context and has a global scope.
      Variables and functions declared in the global scope are accessible from
      anywhere in the script. Function Execution Context: When a function is
      invoked, a new function execution context is created. Each function call
      has its own execution context, which includes information about the
      function's arguments, local variables, and the reference to its outer
      environment (lexical scope). When a function finishes executing, its
      execution context is popped off the stack.

    <script>
      // Global scope
      var globalVariable = "I am in the global scope";

      function outerFunction() {
        var outerVariable = "I am in the outer function";

        function innerFunction() {
          var innerVariable = "I am in the inner function";
          console.log(innerVariable);
          console.log(outerVariable);
          console.log(globalVariable);
        }

        innerFunction();
      }

      outerFunction();
      console.log(globalVariable);
